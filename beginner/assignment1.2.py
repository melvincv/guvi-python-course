Write a program to get two integer inputs, assign them to variables, perform Addition, Multiplication, and Division on the two inputs, and print the results on each line.

Input:

Two integers num1 and num2 (-10^9 ≤ num1, num2 ≤ 10^9).

Output:

Print the results of Addition, Multiplication, and Division on each line.
